I currently have my open source projects [hosted on Bitbucket][0] (with some [GitHub mirrors][1]).

[dancarrollorg_hyde][4]: This site's code. Written in Python using [Hyde][2].

[dancarrollorg][5] : Old version of this site, written in Python using the [Django web framework][3]

[django-activitysync][6]: Social activity aggregator for Django projects

[sitemap-diff][7]: Very simple C# console app for diffing two sitemaps

[FlashCards][8]: A flash card application, mainly used as a reason to experiment with WPF
