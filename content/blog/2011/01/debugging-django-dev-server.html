In continuing my series about setting up a Linux virtual machine for Django development (see parts [one](/blog/2010/12/linux-vm-for-web-development/) and [two](/blog/2010/12/using-windows-to-access-linux-host-name/)), I wanted to share another tip for accessing the VM from the host machine.

Set up development server to listen to external requests
--------------------------------------------------------
By default, when using the Django management <code>[runserver](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/ref/django-admin/#runserver-port-or-ipaddr-port)</code> command, the development server will only listen to requests originating from the local machine (using the loopback address <code>127.0.0.1</code>). Luckily, the runserver command accepts an IP address and port. Specifying <code>0.0.0.0</code> will allow the server to accept requests from any machine:

    python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

I do not have to worry about security issues with the development server listening to all requests, since the VM is protected from external access by a firewall.

Set up server to send debug information to local network
--------------------------------------------------------
While the first step will allow us to access the development server from the host machine, we will not be able to see debugging information (for example, the [django-debug-toolbar](https://github.com/robhudson/django-debug-toolbar) will not be displayed on the host machine, even if <code>[DEBUG](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/ref/settings/#debug)</code> is set to True). Django uses another setting, <code>[INTERNAL_IPS](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/ref/settings/#internal-ips)</code>, to determine which machines are allowed to view debugging information.

For a typical installation, I set <code>INTERNAL_IPS</code> to only specify <code>127.0.0.1</code>, allowing me to easily debug Django apps running on the local machine.

    :::python
    INTERNAL_IPS = ('127.0.0.1',)

Now, since the setting is a tuple, we could easily add the IP address of the host machine and call it a day. We would run into the same problem as the last post, which is the reason I [installed Samba in order to access the VM using its host name instead of IP address](/blog/2010/12/using-windows-to-access-linux-host-name/). Whenever the machine gets a new IP address from the DHCP server, I would have to update the setting. I found a great solution to this problem in this [snippet](http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/1380/), which adds wildcard support to <code>INTERNAL_IPS</code>. I personally put this code inside an if block, so that it only executes in a development setting. Here is the code from the end of my settings.py file:

    :::python
    if DEBUG:

        from fnmatch import fnmatch
        class glob_list(list):
            def __contains__(self, key):
                for elt in self:
                    if fnmatch(key, elt): return True
                return False

        INTERNAL_IPS = glob_list(['127.0.0.1', '192.168.*.*'])

Now, I can access and debug Django projects using the development server from any machine on my local network.
